## Contentment for Umbraco

This NuGet package contains the web asset files for the [main Contentment package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Contentment).

To note, you can still use this NuGet package as the main dependency. The reason for the **Umbraco.Community.Contentment** namespace is to support the Umbraco Marketplace. So you can use either this or that one.
